## The Top 5 Greenest Cities in the U.S.
The bar graph depicts the greenest cities in the U.S. based on evaluations made by Wallethub using 28 relevant metrics graded on a 100 point scale representing the most environmentally friendly practices and policies. The graph depicts the top 5 U.S. cities based on how they score out of 100 points in the categories: total score (abbreviated as Total), environmental score (abbreviated as ENV.), transportation score (abbreviated as Transport), energy score (abbreviated as Energy) and lifestyle policy score (abbreviated as Lifestyle).  In a time defined by a global environmental crisis it’s important to know which cities are acting to curb the impact of global climate change. Humanity has the responsibility to fix the effects of our carbon footprint, therefore people should be informed of the cities that are making the biggest effort to help save the planet. Wallethub made the score evaluations based on data from: The U.S. Census Bureau, Environmental Protection Agency, Trust for Public Land, U.S. Department of Energy - The Alternative Fuels Data Center, Texas A&M Transportation Institute, U.S. Energy Information Administration, Environment America, American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency, Walk Score, Alliance for Biking & Walking, Center for Neighborhood Technology, Bikeshare.com, Indeed, Climate Central, U.S. Geological Survey, TripAdvisor, USDA Organic INTEGRITY Database, American Recyclable Plastic Bag Alliance, lightpollutionmap.info and Yelp.

## Suicidal Thoughts and Actions Among College Students
The graph shows data from the scholarly article “Trends in Mood and Anxiety Symptoms and Suicide-Related Outcomes Among U.S. Undergraduates, 2007–2018: Evidence From Two National Surveys” by Mary E. Duffy, Jean M.Twenge and Thomas E. Joiner. The article describes a study in which the pool of participants were made up of 610,543 undergraduate U.S. college students. The participants “participated in the American College Health Association's NCHA between Fall 2011 and Spring 2018...In this study sample, participants' mean age was 21.25 years (SD = 4.93, median = 20). The sample was 67.7% female, and 72.0% white/Caucasian.” The graph shows the percentage of students of the sample who experienced sucidal thoughts and actions specifically in the categories: so depressed it was difficult to function, seriously considered suicide, and Suicide attempt. The graph shows an increase in suicidal thoughts and actions among college students. This trend is important because it means American college students are experiencing increased feelings of self harm, therefore actions must be taken to help American college students recover from places of severe depression. By sharing graphs with trends of increased rates of self harm and suicidal thoughts among college students society is spreading awareness for the need of resources to help students who are dealing with these issues.

## Top 5 Most Vegan Cities in the World 
The Vegan World blog published the article "Most Vegan Friendly Cities in the World 2021" in which they listed the top vegan cities based on the ratio of amount of vegan restaurants to city population. The map below shows pins on the top 5 cities with the most vegan restaurants in relation to city population. The meat production industry accounts for pollution and is a huge contributor to global climate change. The cities on the map are playing a big role in helping save the environment because switching to a vegan diet aids society's quest to save the environment. Veganism is becoming more normalized in society as people recognize the environmental impact, yet the largest cities in the world aren't in the top 5 most vegan friendly cities. The world is moving towards environmentally friendly habits, but there is more growth to come as the world needs to see larger cities have more vegan restaurants to population ratios. https://theveganword.com/vegan-friendly-cities/

## Intensity of Pregaming at Lehigh University 
The table depicts which party location Lehigh University students feel they need to drink most before attending. The students are divided into the categories of varsity athletes, members of greek life and neither. The party locations are divided by off campus locations, on campus locations and null. The varsity athletes and members of greek life both felt they needed to pregame more before an on campus party whereas students who weren’t members of either of these groups had null as the most popular answer. This information speaks to the party culture at Lehigh University, as it suggests that students in groups may feel the herd mentality to binge drink in social situations related to seeing people from their college community. Presenting this information in an understandable medium allows students to see how their behavior could be harmful and in need of fixing.

## CO2 Emissions and Energy Usage Around the World
The data story depicts a table and map. The table shows the percent total of CO2 emissions by countries across the world. Countries with 0 emissions or less were excluded from the table. The table shows that the two biggest contributors to CO2 emissions are the United States and China. With global climate change posing a huge threat to quality of life it's important to recognize that the United States and China need to play a big part in reducing their carbon emissions. The map shows energy usage of countries around the world. The map shows that the greatest energy users are the United States and China. This data accompanies the previous page, as it shows that the United States and China are greatly contributing to global climate change and must make changes. The data answers the question: What can countries do to reduce their impact on global climate? as the data shows that the United States and China need to reduce carbon emissions and energy usage to make a difference.
